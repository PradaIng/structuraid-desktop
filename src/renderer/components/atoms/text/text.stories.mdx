# Text

This is `Text` atom, used to insert text in our software. 
We have six types of text, indicated by `as` prop;
and could be bold or regular depending on `variant` prop


## Titles

`as = 'big-title'` use this on the software and project titles

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="big-title_bold"
    args={{
      as: "big-title",
      variant: "bold",
      children: "structuraid"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="big-title_regular"
    args={{
      as: "big-title",
      variant: "regular",
      children: "PIP: Lago alto"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


`as = 'title'` use this on titles

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="title_bold"
    args={{
      as: "title",
      variant: "bold",
      children: "foundation blueprint"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="title_regular"
    args={{
      as: "title",
      variant: "regular",
      children: "foundation blueprint"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


`as = 'section-title'` use this on section titles

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="section-title_bold"
    args={{
      as: "section-title",
      variant: "bold",
      children: "RC footing design"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="section-title_regular"
    args={{
      as: "section-title",
      variant: "regular",
      children: "RC footing design"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


`as = 'sub-title'` use this on section subtitles

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="sub-title_bold"
    args={{
      as: "sub-title",
      variant: "bold",
      children: "one-way shear | two-ways shear | bending reinforcement"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="sub-title_regular"
    args={{
      as: "sub-title",
      variant: "regular",
      children: "one-way shear | two-ways shear | bending reinforcement"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>



## Body

We have to font sizes for body:

`as = 'body'` use on content

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="body_bold"
    args={{
      as: "body",
      variant: "bold",
      children: "Reinforced concrete footings are structural members used to support columns and walls and to transmit and distribute their loads to the soil. The design is based on the assumption that the footing is rigid, so that the variation of the soil pressure under the footing is linear. Uniform soil pressure is achieved when the column load coincides with the centroid of the footing. Although this assumption is acceptable for rigid footings, such an assumption becomes less accurate as the footing becomes relatively more flexible."
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="body_regular"
    args={{
      as: "body",
      variant: "regular",
      children: "Reinforced concrete footings are structural members used to support columns and walls and to transmit and distribute their loads to the soil.

    }}

    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

`as = 'body-small'` use on content

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="body-small_bold"
    args={{
      as: "body-small",
      variant: "bold",
      children: "Reinforced concrete footings are structural members used to support columns and walls and to transmit and distribute their loads to the soil.

## Colors

By modifying the `useColor` prop we can change the color of the Text, available options:

- `primary` (by default)

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="text_colors_primary"
    args={{
      as: "body",
      variant: "regular",
      useColor: "primary",
      children: "Reinforced concrete footings are structural members used to support columns and walls and to transmit and distribute their loads to the soil. The design is based on the assumption that the footing is rigid, so that the variation of the soil pressure under the footing is linear. Uniform soil pressure is achieved when the column load coincides with the centroid of the footing. Although this assumption is acceptable for rigid footings, such an assumption becomes less accurate as the footing becomes relatively more flexible."
    }}

    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

- `secondary`

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="text_colors_secondary"
    args={{
      as: "body",
      variant: "regular",
      useColor: "secondary",
      children: "Reinforced concrete footings are structural members used to support columns and walls and to transmit and distribute their loads to the soil.

  </Story>
</Canvas>

- `success`

<Canvas>
